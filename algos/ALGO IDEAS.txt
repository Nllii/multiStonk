basically all these algorithms are are just data sorting (attempting to find patterns in various stocks given the data available

For instance, given a stock is between 0.8 and 5 dollars, it is listed on NASDAQ, and has jumped more than 1.7 times its average price over a period of time, then the stock should gain about 20% within two months since that initial jump

otherwise here's another: given a stock is listed on NASDAQ and has a new drug becoming available, then it is likely that the stock should gan >50% within one month of the acceptance of that drug

Or another: given that a stock has recently split, the price may rise slightly (due to traders now being able to afford the lower price)

or another: stock prices typically fall slightly directly after a dividend is paid out





Some investors purchase shares just before the ex-dividend date and then sell them again right after the date of record—a tactic that can result in a tidy profit if it is done correctly.
